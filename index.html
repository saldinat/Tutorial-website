            Hi! I am Tamara and I am gonna learn how to make vegan pizza and then teach you. Vegan - a strict
            vegetarian who consumes no food (as meat, eggs, or dairy products) that comes from animals; also :
            one who abstains from using animal products (as leather). I am vegan and I have
            experienced firsthand that people have a stereotype about vegans eating only salads. I am gonna try a
            new recipe for me: pizza. By not adding any cheese (vegan, of course) we can reduce calories
            which may be important to some people. Let's try and see!
